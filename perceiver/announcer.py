@brief    API for reporting outcomes of a perceived scene.

A Reporter takes perceiver, monitor, or progress output and reports on its meaning
in some kind of interpretable or standardized stream for interpretation by a human
or by a program.  Having this API permits different reporting mechanisms for the
same computer vision scheme.  Should it be triggered? Should it be CSV output for
Excel processing? Something else for other programs (python or Matlab)?
