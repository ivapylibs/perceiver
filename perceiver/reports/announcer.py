@brief    API for (text) serializing an activity report.

An announcer generates the output that will be sent through the reporting channel.
The most basic version should be plain text, but we can envision other versions
like JSON or csv compliant outputs.  Any data storage scheme is valid as long as
it permits some form of sequential outputting and does not require backtracking.
